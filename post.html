        Writing a blog post is a little like driving; you can study the highway
        code (or read articles telling you how to write a blog post) for months,
        but nothing can prepare you for the real thing like getting behind the
        wheel and hitting the open road. Or something.

        Now that I’m done thoroughly mangling that vague metaphor, let’s get
        down to business. You know you need to <a href="#">start blogging</a> to
        <a href="#">grow your business</a>, but you don’t know how. In this
        post, I’ll show you how to write <a href="#">a great blog post</a> in
        five simple steps that people will actually want to read. Ready? Let’s
        get started.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Write a Blog Post in Five Easy Steps [Summary]:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Step 1: Plan your blog post by choosing a topic, creating an outline,
          conducting research, and checking facts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 2: Craft a headline that is both informative and will capture
          readers’ attentions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 3: Write your post, either writing a draft in a single session or
          gradually word on parts of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 4: Use images to enhance your post, improve its flow, add humor,
          and explain complex topics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 5: <a href="">Edit your blog post</a>. Make sure to avoid
          repetition, read your post aloud to check its flow, have someone else
          read it and provide feedback, keep sentences and paragraphs short,
          don’t be a perfectionist, don’t be afraid to cut out text or adapt
          your writing last minute.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now let's review each step in more detail.</p>

      <h2>How to Write a Blog Post, Step 1: Planning</h2>
      <p>
        First, a disclaimer – the entire process of writing a blog post often
        takes more than a couple of hours, even if you can type eighty words per
        minute and your writing skills are sharp. From the seed of the idea to
        finally hitting “Publish,” you might spend several days or maybe even a
        week “writing” a blog post, but it’s important to spend those vital
        hours planning your post and even thinking about your post (yes,
        thinking counts as working if you’re a blogger) before you actually
        write it.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./Resources/img/circles-and-crosses.png"
          alt="Car with driver and helper"
          class="single"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Does your blog post have enough circles and crosses?
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Long before you sit down to put digital pen to paper, you need to make
        sure you have everything you need to sit down and write. Many new
        bloggers overlook the planning process, and while you might be able to
        get away with skipping the planning stage, doing your homework will
        actually save you time further down the road and help you develop good
        blogging habits.

          Get the Click</a
        >]
      </h3>
      <h3>Choose a Topic That Interests YOU</h3>
      <p>
        There’s an old maxim that states, “No fun for the writer, no fun for the
        reader.” No matter what industry you’re working in, as a blogger, you
        should live and die by this statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you do any of the following steps, be sure to pick a topic that
        actually interests you. Nothing – and I mean NOTHING – will kill a blog
        post more effectively than a lack of enthusiasm from the writer. You can
        tell when a writer is bored by their subject, and it’s so cringe-worthy
        it’s a little embarrassing.

        I can hear your objections already. “But Dan, I have to blog for a
        cardboard box manufacturing company.” I feel your pain, I really do.
        During the course of my career, I’ve written content for dozens of
        clients in some less-than-thrilling industries (such as financial
        regulatory compliance and corporate housing), but the hallmark of a
        professional blogger is the ability to write well about any topic, no
        matter how dry it may be. Blogging is a lot easier, however, if you can
        muster at least a little enthusiasm for the topic at hand.

      <h3>Write an Outline For Your Post</h3>
      <p>
        Great blog posts don’t just happen. Even the best bloggers need a rough
        idea to keep them on-track. This is where outlines come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        An outline doesn’t need to be lengthy, or even detailed – it’s just a
        rough guide to make sure you don’t ramble on and on about something
        tangential to your topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, this is the outline for this post that I sent to my editor
        before getting to work:
      </p>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>[Quick summary explaining what the blog post will cover]</p>
      <h4>Section 1 – Planning a Blog Post</h4>
      <p>
        Things bloggers should do before putting pen to paper – outlining,
        research etc.
      </p>
      <h4>Section 2 – Writing a Blog Post</h4>
      <p>- Tips on how to focus on writing, productivity tips for bloggers</p>
      <h4>Section 3 – Rewriting/Editing a Blog Post</h4>
      <p>
        - Self-editing techniques, things to watch out for, common blogging
        mistakes
      </p>
      <h4>Section 4 – Optimizing a Blog Post</h4>
      <p>
        - How to optimize a blog post for on-page SEO, social shares/engagement,
        etc.
      </p>
      <h4>Section 5 – Conclusion</h4>
      <p>- Wrap-up</p>

      <p>
        The purpose of this outline is to make sure I know what I plan to cover,
        in what order the various sections will appear, and some bare-bones
        details of what each section will include.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outlines keep you honest. They stop you from indulging in poorly
        thought-out metaphors about driving and keep you focused on the overall
        structure of your post. Sometimes I’ll write a more thorough outline
        (and sometimes I won’t bother with one at all), but most of the time,
        something like the outline above is perfectly acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you write your outline in your word processor, on a piece of
        paper, or even scribbled on a bar napkin, do whatever works for you to
        keep you focused.
      </p>
      <h3>Do Your Research</h3>
      <p>
        One of the biggest secrets professional bloggers (myself included) don’t
        want you to know is that we don’t actually know everything. Truth be
        told, sometimes we don’t know anything about a topic before we sit down
        to write about it.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./Resources/img/pro-tip.jpg"
          alt="Car with driver and helper"
          class="single"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Pro tip: you don't actually need a passport to write a travel
          marketing post.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        This doesn’t mean that all bloggers are insincere fakers. On the
        contrary, many bloggers’ natural curiosity is what makes them great at
        what they do. If you blog for a living, you have to be comfortable
        jumping from one topic to the next, even if you don’t know anything
        about it. What allows us to do this, and to write authoritatively about
        subject areas that are new to us, is knowing how to properly research a
        blog post.
      </p>
      <p>
        It almost goes without saying, but relying solely on Wikipedia as a
        primary source is almost always a bad idea. Yes, Wikipedia does have
        thousands of excellently researched articles, but it’s not infallible,
        and erroneous facts do make their way into articles without site editors
        noticing. Plus, every verifiable fact on the site is cited from links
        elsewhere on the web, so why cite the middleman?
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./Resources/img/wiki-pedia.jpg"

      </figure>
      <p>
        If you’re relying on third-party information to write your blog post,
        choose authoritative sources. Official associations, government
        websites, heavily cited research papers, and preeminent industry experts
        are all good examples. Nobody is right all the time, though, so approach
        every source with a the practiced skepticism of a journalist and
        question everything until you’re positive your information is solid.

        <strong>NOTE</strong>: A lot of people struggle with writing
        introductions. A great strategy is to write the introduction last. Just
        get into the meat of the blog post, and worry about the introduction
        later. Here are five easy ways to write a great introduction.

      <p>
        Blogging is one of those jobs that seems easy until you have to do it.
        Fortunately, it does get easier, and with time and practice, you’ll be
        blogging like a pro in no time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there’s an aspect of writing a blog post that I didn’t cover, or you
        have specific questions about my process or anything generally
        blog-related, let me know in the comments – I’ll answer them as best I
        can.
